# Unemployment in India

## Project Overview  
This project delves into the analysis of **unemployment trends across various regions in India**, exploring the distribution, variability, and patterns in unemployment rates.  
The analysis is based on datasets containing information on **estimated unemployment, employment figures, and labor participation rates** across multiple Indian states.

## Data Sources  
The primary datasets used for this analysis include:  
- **Unemployment_in_India.csv**  
- **Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv**  

These datasets cover **various regions and time periods** and were pre-processed to ensure **data quality and consistency**.

## Key Steps in the Analysis  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- **Handled missing values** and standardized column names.  
- Removed inconsistencies to improve **data reliability**.  

### 2. Data Exploration  
- Conducted **descriptive statistics** and explored **data distribution**.  
- Examined the variations in **unemployment rates, employment numbers, and labor participation rates**.  

### 3. Data Visualization  
- **Count Plots**: Highlighted the distribution of data across regions to understand data representation.  
- **Bar Plots**: Illustrated **average unemployment and labor participation rates** by region.  
- **Box Plots**: Displayed the **distribution and variability** of unemployment and employment rates across different states.  
- **Scatter Plots & Pair Plots**: Analyzed relationships between **unemployment rate, employment figures, and labor participation rates**.  
- **Histograms & KDE Plots**: Showed the **distribution of key variables**, revealing patterns in unemployment and employment.  

### 4. Regional Analysis  
- Identified states with the **highest and lowest average unemployment rates**, such as **Tripura (highest) and Meghalaya (lowest)**.  
- Analyzed **regional disparities** in labor participation and employment, highlighting areas with **economic stability and instability**.  

### 5. Time Series Analysis  
- Investigated **temporal trends** in unemployment rates, particularly during the **COVID-19 period**, which caused significant disruptions in many regions.
